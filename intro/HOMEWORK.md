# Homework

1. Please create a new Github repository called "process_loan_data"
2. Use what we did previously for [Project 1](https://github.com/learnwithshin/core-python/blob/main/course_2/project_1_solution.ipynb), make a python program (you can call it `main.py` or anything you want). Note that in order to run your Python program, you have to also have the `resources` folder that contains all the necessary csv files in the repo.
3. Push the project to your Github repo `process_loan_data`.

Bonus:
Try to break the porject into two files, namely `main.py` and `helper_func.py`. The `main.py` contains only the main function and it imports the necessary functions from the `helper_func` module.
